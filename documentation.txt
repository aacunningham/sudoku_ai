The Sudoku Solver
By Aaron Cunningham


Building on Linux (and maybe Mac):
Make sure you have C++11 available on your computer, as well as cmake and make

I believe the project also relies on the Boost Unit Test Framework, but if you delete the `tests` folder,
you should be fine.

In a new directory (either within the project code or alongside it), run in the terminal:

    cmake /location/of/the/project

This should build the correct tools to create the project, so you can then run:

    make

This will build the executables for the project. If you want to run the test units, 
you should also run the python script which will pull in puzzles from sudokupuzzles.org.
Run the file (from the same folder you ran make) as such:

    python /location/of/the/project/script.py

To run the tests, use the following command:

    ./tests/Test

To run the program, run this command:

    ./Sudoku_AI


Building on Windows:
I really don't know how to help you. Try changing Sudoku_AIConfig.h.in to Sudoku_AIConfig.h, and change the
text within from @...@ to whatever numbers you want.

Then just build main.cpp and SudokuClass/sudoku.cpp together and it should work (hopefully!).
If not, then you'll just have to read the source code and take my word on the results.



Results:

The code successfully solve sudoku problems of any perfect square number (4, 9, 16, ...). It can also create
puzzles as well, though this process becomes a lot longer for anything larger than 16x16 puzzles.

Based off of puzzles retrieved from sudokupuzzles.org, the assignment can solve the most simple puzzles in
around 5ms, and the most difficult in anywhere from 1s to 10s to 1min. The AI Escargot puzzle, noted as
being the most difficult to solve, takes around .8s to solve. The easiest problems never had to backtrack, while
the more difficult puzzles involved 400-1400 backtracks.

The project can also check if a sudoku has multiple solutions, though this is not accessible through
the driver program. This code is used to check whether a created puzzle is valid or not, as well
made puzzles only have 1 solution.
